Some examples using [Unmock](https://unmock.io) with 3rd party APIs.

### Batch scripts

[run.sh](./run.sh) can be used to run a script for all examples as follows:

```bash
# Run tests for all directories or directories matching a pattern
./run.sh test [dir-name-pattern]

# Upgrade Unmock for all directories or directories matching a pattern
./run.sh upgrade [dir-name-pattern]
```
